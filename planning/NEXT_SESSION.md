>
> Last Updated: January 3, 2026

---

## Session: 2026-01-03

### Accomplished
- ✅ **Extended Distributional Analysis** to multiple policy types:
  - `TaxCreditPolicy` — Credits with phase-in/phase-out by income
  - `TCJAExtensionPolicy` — TPC-based component distribution
  - `CorporateTaxPolicy` — 75/25 capital/labor incidence
  - `PayrollTaxPolicy` — Wage distribution up to SS cap
- ✅ **Validated Against TPC** (TCJA distributional analysis):
  - Middle quintile: 10% share (exact match)
  - Top quintile: 65% vs 68% (4.4% error)
  - Overall score: GOOD
- ✅ **Designed FRB/US Macro Adapter** (`fiscal_model/models/macro_adapter.py`):
  - `MacroModelAdapter` abstract interface
  - `SimpleMultiplierAdapter` for reduced-form analysis (working)
  - `FRBUSAdapter` placeholder for FRB/US integration
  - `MacroScenario` and `MacroResult` data classes
  - `policy_to_scenario()` converter
- ✅ **Updated Documentation**:
  - METHODOLOGY.md: Added distributional analysis section, updated comparison tables
  - VALIDATION.md: Created comprehensive validation results (25+ policies)
  - CLAUDE.md: Updated with new modules and code examples

### FRB/US Integration Opportunity
User has FRB/US model at `C:\Users\lwils\Projects\apps\Economy_Forecasts`:
- pyfrbus package with model.xml and LONGBASE.TXT
- Can enable Yale Budget Lab-style dynamic scoring
- Next step: Map fiscal scenarios to FRB/US shock variables

### Remaining for Phase 3
- [ ] Unit tests for distributional analysis
- [ ] Error handling improvements
- [ ] Full FRB/US integration (map fiscal policy to model variables)

---

## Session: 2024-12-30 (Part 10)

### Accomplished
- ✅ **Implemented Distributional Analysis Module** (`fiscal_model/distribution.py`):
  - `DistributionalEngine` class for computing tax changes by income group
  - `IncomeGroupType` enum: quintiles, deciles, JCT dollar brackets
  - `DistributionalResult` dataclass with full TPC/JCT metrics
  - `IncomeGroup` dataclass with IRS-based income distributions
  - `format_distribution_table()` for TPC/JCT style output
  - `generate_winners_losers_summary()` for policy impact summary
- ✅ **Income Group Definitions**:
  - 2024 quintile thresholds: $0-35K, $35-65K, $65-105K, $105-170K, $170K+
  - 2024 decile thresholds (10 groups)
  - JCT-style dollar brackets ($10K increments up to $1M+)
  - Top income breakout: Top 20%, 10%, 5%, 1%, 0.1%
- ✅ **Metrics Implemented**:
  - Average tax change per return ($)
  - Tax change as % of after-tax income
  - Share of total tax change by group
  - Percent with tax increase/decrease (winners/losers)
  - Effective tax rate change (ppts)
  - Baseline and new ETR
- ✅ **Updated Streamlit UI**:
  - New "Distribution" tab with income grouping selector
  - Summary metrics (total change, % increase/decrease)
  - TPC-style distribution table
  - Bar chart of average tax change by group
  - Pie chart of share of total tax change
  - Winners/losers summary
  - Top income group detail breakout

### Key Insight: Distributional Methodology
- TPC uses "Expanded Cash Income" (ECI) - we approximate with AGI
- Income groups based on 2024 Census/TPC quintile thresholds
- Partial bracket effects estimated using linear interpolation
- Top bracket (open-ended) uses average AGI to estimate affected fraction
- Synthetic IRS data generated when actual SOI files unavailable

### Test Results
```
Biden $400K+ Tax Increase (2.6pp):
- Total tax change: $119B (year 1)
- Only top quintile affected (5.2% of taxpayers)
- Top 0.1% bears 66.8% of burden
- Average increase for top quintile: $12,553

Middle Class Tax Cut (2pp for $50K+):
- Total tax change: -$266B (year 1)
- 53.3% of taxpayers get a cut
- Top quintile gets largest cut ($9,656 avg)
- Middle quintile: $1,853 avg cut
```

### 2. 🏗️ Step-Up Basis Modeling (Next)

**Why**: PWBM shows step-up basis creates fundamentally different behavioral response. With step-up, high cap gains rates lose revenue; without, they raise revenue.

**Key Features**:
```python
class CapitalGainsPolicy(TaxPolicy):
    # Existing (implemented)
    short_run_elasticity: float = 0.8   # Years 1-3
    long_run_elasticity: float = 0.4    # Years 4+
    transition_years: int = 3

    # Needed for step-up modeling
    step_up_at_death: bool = True       # Current law default
    step_up_exemption: float = 1_000_000  # Biden proposal exemption
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Add `step_up_at_death` parameter
2. Model step-up as separate revenue channel (not just elasticity)
3. Validate against PWBM with-step-up scenario
